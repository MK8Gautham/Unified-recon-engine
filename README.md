Unified Collections Reconciliation Portal

**Demo**: https://earnest-biscochitos-360a39.netlify.app

**Problem Statement**
Today, merchants collect payments from diverse channels.
BBPS bill payments (often via multiple vendors like Axis, Pine, Canara)
Payment gateways (Razorpay, PayU, Cashfree, etc.)
Custom flows like WhatsApp-based bill payments or direct links

Each channel:
Settles independently (usually T+1)
Sends a settlement file (e.g. MPRs) in its own format
Offers no unified view
Leads to fragmented reporting, blind spots, and manual reconciliations
